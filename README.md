## Aim
1. Milestone-1 of this assignment aims to ensure that we can transfer data reliably by sending UDP requests slowly.
2. Milestone-2 of this assignment aims to ensure that we can transfer data reliably while incorporating congestion control mechanisms to the case where the server maintains a constant rate and works under the leaky bucket framework . Because of this assumption , we can optimise our approach to more efficiently receive the needed data on the top of reliability.
3. Our final server, Milestone - 3 has a variable rate server where we need to construct a generic client that adjusts its burst rate accordingly with the inferred token refilling rate of the server.

## Contents
We present reports for Milestone 2 and 3, along with their codes.
